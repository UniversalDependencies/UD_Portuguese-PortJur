# Introduction

As reported by [Lopes et al. (2025)](https://sol.sbc.org.br/index.php/stil/article/view/37827), the legal portion of Porttinari includes public law texts produced by the judiciary (mainly summaries) and the legislature (laws), including widely known laws in Brazil, as Henry Borel law, Internet Civil Rights law, Maria da Penha law, Copyright law, Agrarian Reform law, Elderly Persons statute and Child and Adolescent statute. The data was automatically annotated by a state of the art parser ([Portparser.v2](https://github.com/LuceleneL/Portparser.v2)) and manually revised by human experts. To support specialized studies and computational applications, some resources were also produced from this portion of Porttinari, as lists of content words (i.e., nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs -- totalizing 4,994 words),  propor nouns (627), verb forms (3,073), abbreviations (22), and foreign expressions (50).
